# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

An example of the data stored is 

| Date | Description | Category | Amount  |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Sep 23 2022 | bought a house | Expenses | 10 BTC |
| Sep 24 2022 | food for house celebration | Food | 0.000001 BTC |




## Design statement:
I will to design and make a Ethruuen Wallet for a client who is trying to set up an acounnt. The wallet will hold currency and is constructed using the software pyhton. It will take  30 days to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria (please check succes critera 1-6).

## Rationale for Proposed Solution
I chose Python because itâ€™s one of the most user-friendly programming languages that is quickly growing globally. [1] According to Linked In, python is easy to understand because of its simple English syntax that allows the programmer to create programs easily.[2] Python also has access to numerous libraries that allow developers to program more efficiently. These libraries provide an API (application programming interface) which makes it easy for developers to use them with their own software programs.[3] Furthermore, Pythons is versatile language that can be used for web development, software development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.[4] Thats why I believe Python will be able to solve all of my client's problems and let her have a functioning crypto wallet.



## Description of Ethereum
** Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain network powered by the Ether token. It enables users to transact, earn interest on their holdings through staking, use and store nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and trade cryptocurrencies. [5] Ethereum is a global platform that uses a digital ledger through multiple computers to maintain a secure and decentralized record of transactions.[6] The growth of Ethereum is expected to continue due to its widespread adoption as a platform with ongoing technological advancements, increased institutional interest, and a growing ecosystem of innovative projects; Ethereum's value is likely to rise because of its central role in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance and digital assets.[7] **


## Success Criteria

2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The elctronic ledger displays current rate of coin
5. Login and Logout of Account
