### Definition of the Problem

Yuikos Stuffed Animal Incorporated has been selling stuffed animals for six months. Yuiko’s stuffed animals are family-friendly toys that bring happiness to the whole family. Over the past few weeks Yuiko has reportedly been offered many lucrative deals to sell her company, but opted instead to continue the business on her own. As the business has grown, Yuiko herself has found it difficult to manage orders. And is in urgent need of an application to manage raw materials, track transactions, and create stuffed animals if sufficient resources are there. Yuiko wants the application to be password-protected and encrypted so no trade secrets are leaked. Yuiko has also demanded that the application graph the influx of raw resources in and out of the company.



### Success criteria
 1. The application contains account registration and login feature using username email and adequate password.
 2. Differentiates normal readers and editor accounts which would have an option to add articles if their account is authorized as a journalism club member.Viewers can only read. Editors have a feature of adding articles.
 3. Application will have a feature to add an article and safely store it.
 4. Option to see image of the article, allowing full expirience of digital newspapers.
 5. Option to view past articles containing the author, title, and its content.
 6. Option to select multiple articles and read them one after another, just like in digital newspapers.
 7. Option to delete articles created by the user logged in.
 


### Design statement
I will design an aplication for Jonathan Wang Ye, UWC ISAK student. This will be a journalism club application and will serve to display Isak insider articles in digital format. It will be a desktop application, and will be developed in the one month period.

### Rationale for proposed solution
For this project, I will use the Python programming language, KivyMD library for the graphic user interface, and SQL lite for databases to store the information.


Based on the client’s request, I will be working on designing and developing an application can easily mangage Yuikos Stuffed Animals incorporate. The application will run on the programing language Python, KivyMD library for the user interface, and SQL Lite for the databases of the application.

#### Why Python?
Python has over 8.2 million Python developers[^1]. Meaning Python is an active community that offers a lof of support for projects. Python is an effective choice for many kinds of development projects[^2]. A wide range of resources and libraries to create the perfect program. Python has a simple syntax that allows users to understand and develop code more easily[^3].
#### Why KivyMD?
One of the main advantages of using **KivyMD** is that it allows developers to build applications that can run on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows. This makes it an ideal choice when targeting wide & international audiance like ISAK's journalism club application would.It is also very suitable for co-developing due to small number of variables used allowing easy interpretation and allowing easy extensibility of the application. This can help to save time and effort, allowing developers to focus on creating their app's functionality and features[^4].
When compared to another UI creating software such as Flutter, KivyMD has more advantage on some components like more supportive online community, user-friendliness but most importantly KivyMD is better as it can work with python coding language while Flutter cannot which therefore is more suitable in this project.[^5]
#### Why SQL?
**SQL** is designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently. This makes it an ideal choice for applications that needs to scale as they grow such as this one, as SQL databases can be easily expanded to meet the needs of the application. SQL databases allow for the storage of structured data, which can be easily queried and manipulated. This makes it easier to find the information you need, and to perform complex data analysis tasks. SQL databases are highly reliable ensuring the data stored in the database remains accurate and up-to-date.[^6]
