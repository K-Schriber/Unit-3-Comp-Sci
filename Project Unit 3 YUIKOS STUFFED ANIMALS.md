# Criteria A-Planning 
### Definition of the Problem
UWC ISAK Japan is a school that always strives to be more environmentally friendly, but due to high demand for copies of ISAK INSIDER articles every week, a lot of paper is being used to print them. This especially bothered Jonathan Wang Ye, who is considered by many, number one environmentalist at ISAK, probably even Japan. He is in urgent need for an UWC ISAK journalism club application which would store articles that ISAK INSIDER publishes every week in addition to storing articles from past weeks. He also demands the highest level of security due to the fact that this would be an official school app, so all the passwords must be encrypted, protecting data of app's users. Other than being more green, additional benefit of this app would be that it would nake articles available anywhere in the world, allowing fans and alumni of the school outside ISAK to enjoy it.
This way everyone would be able to enjoy ISAK INSIDER without hurting the environment by wasting paper in the process.


### Success criteria
 1. The application contains account registration and login feature using username email and adequate password.
 2. Differentiates normal readers and editor accounts which would have an option to add articles if their account is authorized as a journalism club member.Viewers can only read. Editors have a feature of adding articles.
 3. Application will have a feature to add an article and safely store it.
 4. Option to see image of the article, allowing full expirience of digital newspapers.
 5. Option to view past articles containing the author, title, and its content.
 6. Option to select multiple articles and read them one after another, just like in digital newspapers.
 7. Option to delete articles created by the user logged in.
 


### Design statement
I will design an aplication for Jonathan Wang Ye, UWC ISAK student. This will be a journalism club application and will serve to display Isak insider articles in digital format. It will be a desktop application, and will be developed in the one month period.

### Rationale for proposed solution
For the development of this project, I will use Python programming language, KivyMD library for the user interface, and SQL for the databases used in the application.

Considering the client's requests, I will design and develop this easy-to-use centralized application for managing UWC ISAK's journalism club articles. It will be developed using Python programming language, KivyMD library for the user interface, and SQL for the databases used in the application.
#### Why Python?
**Python** Python versatility allows a great cross platform development[^1] which is a neccesity for the application I will be developing. Python has a large and active community of users and developers. [^2] Python has a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy for new developers to adapt to code and efficiently continue develpment[^3]. 
#### Why KivyMD?
One of the main advantages of using **KivyMD** is that it allows developers to build applications that can run on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows. This makes it an ideal choice when targeting wide & international audiance like ISAK's journalism club application would.It is also very suitable for co-developing due to small number of variables used allowing easy interpretation and allowing easy extensibility of the application. This can help to save time and effort, allowing developers to focus on creating their app's functionality and features[^4].
When compared to another UI creating software such as Flutter, KivyMD has more advantage on some components like more supportive online community, user-friendliness but most importantly KivyMD is better as it can work with python coding language while Flutter cannot which therefore is more suitable in this project.[^5]
#### Why SQL?
**SQL** is designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently. This makes it an ideal choice for applications that needs to scale as they grow such as this one, as SQL databases can be easily expanded to meet the needs of the application. SQL databases allow for the storage of structured data, which can be easily queried and manipulated. This makes it easier to find the information you need, and to perform complex data analysis tasks. SQL databases are highly reliable ensuring the data stored in the database remains accurate and up-to-date.[^6]
